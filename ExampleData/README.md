## Description of example data 
  

Before using the example file, extract the "Ex_genotype.zip" file.


1. "Ex_genotype.txt" 
   - This file consists of 36,091 SNP markers (row) and 413 samples (column).
   - SNP markers belongs to chromsomes 1-12, and samples were named as Sample1, Sample2, Sample3 ..., and Sample413.
   - Markers are coded as -1, 0, 1, and 2 along missing, homozygous reference, heterozygous, and homozygous alternative genotypes. 


2. "Ex_phenotype.txt" 
   - This file is the phenotype data of 413 samples, and consistis of two columns, the Sample ID and the phenotype value.
   - The phenotype column in the example file was named "Phenotype".


3. "Ex_gwas.txt"
   - This file is the result of a genome-wide association study between the 413 sample samples and their phenotypes.
